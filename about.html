<div class="about-content">
  <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
  <p>We started Smart Home Simplified because we were tired of "review" sites that had clearly never touched the products they recommended. You know the ones — they copy specs from Amazon, slap on an affiliate link, and call it a "comprehensive review." We've been there as buyers, frustrated by recommendations that fell apart the moment we plugged something in.</p>
  <p>Smart home technology should make your life easier, not harder. But with hundreds of devices across dozens of ecosystems, choosing the right products feels overwhelming. That's the problem we solve. We buy the products, test them in real homes, and tell you exactly what works — and what doesn't.</p>

  <h2>How We Test</h2>
  <p>Every product recommendation on this site has been physically tested. We don't rely on press releases or manufacturer claims. Here's our process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>We buy retail.</strong> No manufacturer-provided review units. We buy everything at full price from the same stores you use, so our experience matches yours.</li>
    <li><strong>We test for weeks, not hours.</strong> A smart thermostat that works great on day one might have connectivity issues on day 15. We run extended tests to catch real-world problems.</li>
    <li><strong>We test compatibility.</strong> A smart plug in isolation is easy. A smart plug that needs to work with your Echo, your Google Home, and your SmartThings hub? That's where things get interesting. We test cross-ecosystem compatibility because that's how people actually use these devices.</li>
    <li><strong>We consider the total cost.</strong> A $99 camera with a $100/year subscription isn't a $99 camera. We factor in subscription fees, hub requirements, and ecosystem lock-in when making recommendations.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Editorial Policy</h2>
  <p>Some links on this site are affiliate links. When you buy a product through our links, we earn a small commission at no extra cost to you. This is how we fund our testing and keep the site running.</p>
  <p>Here's what we promise:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Commissions never influence rankings.</strong> We recommend the best product, then find the affiliate link — not the other way around.</li>
    <li><strong>We disclose everything.</strong> Every article with affiliate links has a clear disclosure at the top.</li>
    <li><strong>We update regularly.</strong> Prices change, new products launch, and old ones get discontinued. We review and update every article quarterly.</li>
    <li><strong>We'll tell you when NOT to buy.</strong> If the best move is to wait for a sale or skip a product category entirely, we'll say so.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What We Cover</h2>
  <p>We focus on the core smart home categories that matter most to people building or upgrading their homes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Smart Home Hubs</strong> — the brains of your setup</li>
    <li><strong>Security Cameras & Video Doorbells</strong> — keeping your home safe</li>
    <li><strong>Smart Lighting</strong> — the easiest place to start</li>
    <li><strong>Smart Thermostats</strong> — comfort and energy savings</li>
    <li><strong>Robot Vacuums</strong> — because nobody likes vacuuming</li>
    <li><strong>Smart Speakers</strong> — your voice-controlled command center</li>
    <li><strong>Smart Locks</strong> — keyless entry done right</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We also publish budget guides, beginner tutorials, and deal roundups to help you get the most value for your money.</p>
