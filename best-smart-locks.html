<article class="article-content">
  <p>A smart lock is one of those upgrades that sounds like a luxury until you have one — then you can't imagine going back to fumbling for keys. Auto-unlock when you walk up to your door. Let the dog walker in while you're at work. Get an alert when your kid gets home from school. Lock the door from bed when you're not sure if you remembered to lock it. These aren't futuristic fantasies anymore. They're a $150 upgrade.</p>
  <p>We tested eight of the most popular smart locks in 2026, installing each on a real exterior door and living with them for at least three weeks. We evaluated them on security, installation ease, smart home integration, battery life, and daily reliability. Here's what we found.</p>

  <h2>How We Tested</h2>
  <p>Every lock on this list was installed on an exterior door in a real home. We evaluated:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Installation difficulty</strong> — can an average person install this with a screwdriver and the included instructions?</li>
    <li><strong>Auto-lock/unlock reliability</strong> — does it consistently detect when you arrive and leave?</li>
    <li><strong>Smart home integration</strong> — how well does it work with Alexa, Google, Apple Home, and automation hubs?</li>
    <li><strong>Battery life</strong> — how long before you're swapping batteries?</li>
    <li><strong>Physical security</strong> — ANSI/BHMA grade, resistance to picking, bumping, and forced entry</li>
    <li><strong>Daily UX</strong> — response speed, app quality, guest access management</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1. August Wi-Fi Smart Lock (4th Gen) — Best Overall</h3>
  <div class="product-box pick">
    <h4>🏆 Our Pick: August Wi-Fi Smart Lock (4th Gen)</h4>
    <div class="price">$230</div>
    <p>August has been the smart lock king for years, and the 4th generation cements that position. This is a retrofit lock — it replaces only the inside portion of your existing deadbolt, so you keep your existing keys and exterior hardware. Installation takes 10 minutes with a screwdriver. No drilling, no replacing hardware your landlord will notice.</p>
    <p>What makes it the best? The auto-unlock is the most reliable of any lock we tested. It uses your phone's GPS and Bluetooth to detect when you're approaching and unlocks before you reach the door. In three weeks of testing, it failed exactly once. The auto-lock feature re-locks the door after a configurable time (we set ours to 30 seconds) — so you never leave the door unlocked by accident.</p>
    <p>Wi-Fi is built in (no separate bridge needed), and Thread support means it works beautifully with Apple Home and Matter-compatible hubs. It integrates with Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Home natively. Battery life was excellent — the app estimates 6 months on a set of CR123 batteries, and our usage corroborated that claim.</p>
    <p>The optional August Keypad ($50 extra) adds a code entry option for the exterior — great for guests, house cleaners, and dog walkers. You can create temporary codes that expire after a set time.</p>
    <div class="pros-cons">
      <div class="pros"><strong>Pros</strong><ul><li>Easiest installation (10 min, no drilling)</li><li>Most reliable auto-unlock of any lock tested</li><li>Keep your existing keys and exterior hardware</li><li>Wi-Fi + Thread built in</li><li>Works with all three voice assistants</li><li>Excellent app with guest access management</li></ul></div>
      <div class="cons"><strong>Cons</strong><ul><li>No built-in keypad (optional $50 add-on)</li><li>More expensive than keypad-included alternatives</li><li>CR123 batteries are pricier than AA</li></ul></div>

  <h3>2. Yale Assure Lock 2 — Best Full Replacement Lock</h3>
  <div class="product-box">
    <h4>Yale Assure Lock 2</h4>
    <div class="price">$200</div>
    <p>If you want a complete lock replacement with a built-in keypad, the Yale Assure Lock 2 is the one. It's available in multiple styles and finishes, with a touchscreen keypad on the exterior for code entry. The big selling point: it's one of the first residential smart locks with full Matter support, meaning it works natively with every major ecosystem now and in the future.</p>
    <p>Installation is more involved than the August — you're replacing the entire deadbolt assembly, which takes 20–30 minutes. But the instructions are excellent, and Yale includes a door compatibility checker in the app. The keypad is responsive and works even with wet or gloved fingers (a real-world concern in winter). Battery life on 4 AA batteries is rated at 9 months; we'll update when we get there.</p>
    <p>Auto-lock is solid but auto-unlock is slightly less reliable than August's — it occasionally needed a second or two of waiting at the door. Not a dealbreaker, but noticeable if you're comparing side by side.</p>
    <div class="pros-cons">
      <div class="pros"><strong>Pros</strong><ul><li>Full Matter support (most future-proof)</li><li>Built-in touchscreen keypad</li><li>Multiple style and finish options</li><li>Excellent 9-month battery life (AA batteries)</li><li>Works with all ecosystems</li></ul></div>
      <div class="cons"><strong>Cons</strong><ul><li>Full deadbolt replacement (more work to install)</li><li>Auto-unlock slightly less reliable than August</li><li>Touchscreen can be slow in cold weather</li></ul></div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>3. Schlage Encode Plus — Best for Apple Home</h3>
  <div class="product-box">
    <h4>Schlage Encode Plus</h4>
    <div class="price">$300</div>
    <p>The Schlage Encode Plus was the first residential lock to support Apple Home Key — meaning you can unlock your door by tapping your iPhone or Apple Watch, just like using Apple Pay. No app needed, no code, just tap and go. For Apple households, this feature alone is worth the premium.</p>
    <p>Beyond Apple Home Key, the Encode Plus is a rock-solid deadbolt with ANSI/BHMA Grade 1 security — the highest residential rating. It's built like a tank. The built-in keypad supports up to 100 access codes, and the Schlage Home app is clean and functional. Wi-Fi is built in, so no bridge or hub is required.</p>
    <p>At $300, it's the priciest lock on our list. It's also the largest — the interior mechanism is chunky. If you're not in the Apple ecosystem, the Yale Assure Lock 2 gives you more flexibility for $100 less.</p>
    <div class="pros-cons">
      <div class="pros"><strong>Pros</strong><ul><li>Apple Home Key (tap to unlock with iPhone/Watch)</li><li>ANSI/BHMA Grade 1 (highest security rating)</li><li>Up to 100 access codes</li><li>Built-in Wi-Fi, no bridge needed</li><li>Schlage's legendary build quality</li></ul></div>
      <div class="cons"><strong>Cons</strong><ul><li>Most expensive option at $300</li><li>Bulky interior mechanism</li><li>Apple Home Key only works with Apple devices</li><li>No Matter support yet</li></ul></div>
    </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>4. Ultraloq U-Bolt Pro WiFi — Most Unlock Methods</h3>
  <div class="product-box">
    <h4>Ultraloq U-Bolt Pro WiFi</h4>
    <div class="price">$200</div>
    <p>The U-Bolt Pro gives you six ways to unlock: fingerprint, keypad code, auto-unlock, app, mechanical key, and shake to open (Bluetooth). The fingerprint reader is fast — sub-second recognition in our testing — and can store up to 100 fingerprints. It's the most versatile entry system on the list.</p>
    <p>Build quality is good but not Schlage-level. It has an ANSI Grade 2 rating (standard for residential). The U-tec app works but isn't as polished as August or Yale's apps. Smart home integration is decent — Alexa and Google work well, Apple Home requires a bridge.</p>
    <div class="pros-cons">
      <div class="pros"><strong>Pros</strong><ul><li>6 unlock methods including fingerprint</li><li>Fast, reliable fingerprint sensor</li><li>Built-in Wi-Fi</li><li>Mechanical key backup</li><li>Good price for features offered</li></ul></div>
      <div class="cons"><strong>Cons</strong><ul><li>App needs polish</li><li>Apple Home requires separate bridge</li><li>ANSI Grade 2 (not Grade 1)</li></ul></div>
    </div>
    <div class="cta-box">
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Ultraloq%20U-Bolt%20Pro%20WiFi&tag=sirlim06-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" data-affiliate="TODO">Check Price on Amazon</a>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>5. Level Lock+ — Best Looking (Invisible Design)</h3>
  <div class="product-box">
    <h4>Level Lock+</h4>
    <div class="price">$330</div>
    <p>The Level Lock+ is the only smart lock that's truly invisible. All the electronics hide inside the deadbolt itself — from the outside, your door looks completely normal with a standard keyhole. No keypad, no chunky electronic housing, nothing to signal "this is a smart lock" to anyone looking.</p>
    <p>You unlock via your phone (auto-unlock or app), Apple Home Key (tap to unlock), or a physical key. Thread and Matter support make it future-proof. The downside? No keypad means no code entry for guests — they need the app or a physical key. At $330, it's also premium-priced for what it does.</p>
    <p>This is the lock for design-conscious homeowners who want smart functionality without changing the look of their door.</p>
    <div class="pros-cons">
      <div class="pros"><strong>Pros</strong><ul><li>Completely invisible — looks like a normal lock</li><li>Apple Home Key support</li><li>Thread and Matter compatible</li><li>Compact — fits any door</li></ul></div>
      <div class="cons"><strong>Cons</strong><ul><li>No keypad (guest access limited)</li><li>Most expensive on our list</li><li>Limited to Apple/Thread ecosystem for best experience</li></ul></div>
    </div>
    <div class="cta-box">
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Level%20Lock%2B&tag=sirlim06-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" data-affiliate="TODO">Check Price on Amazon</a>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>6. Kwikset Halo Touch — Best Fingerprint Lock</h3>
  <div class="product-box">
    <h4>Kwikset Halo Touch</h4>
    <div class="price">$220</div>
    <p>If fingerprint unlock is your priority and you want a name-brand lock, the Kwikset Halo Touch delivers. The fingerprint sensor is built into the exterior and stores up to 100 prints. Recognition is fast and works well even with slightly damp fingers. The build quality is classic Kwikset — solid and reliable with an ANSI Grade 2 rating.</p>
    <p>Wi-Fi built in, works with Alexa and Google, and the Kwikset app is straightforward. The main downside is no Apple Home support without a workaround, and no Matter support yet.</p>
    <div class="pros-cons">
      <div class="pros"><strong>Pros</strong><ul><li>Excellent fingerprint reader</li><li>100 fingerprint capacity</li><li>Trusted Kwikset brand</li><li>Built-in Wi-Fi</li><li>SmartKey re-keying system</li></ul></div>
      <div class="cons"><strong>Cons</strong><ul><li>No Apple Home support</li><li>No Matter/Thread</li><li>App is basic compared to competitors</li></ul></div>
    </div>
    <div class="cta-box">
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Kwikset%20Halo%20Touch&tag=sirlim06-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm" data-affiliate="TODO">Check Price on Amazon</a>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>7. Wyze Lock Bolt — Best Budget Smart Lock</h3>
  <div class="product-box">
    <h4>Wyze Lock Bolt</h4>
    <div class="price">$70</div>
    <p>At $70, the Wyze Lock Bolt is by far the cheapest smart lock worth buying. It has a fingerprint reader and keypad on the exterior, Bluetooth connectivity, and the Wyze app for management. The fingerprint reader is surprisingly good for the price — not quite as fast as the Kwikset or Ultraloq, but reliable.</p>
    <p>The big limitation is Bluetooth only — no Wi-Fi means you can't control it remotely unless your phone is nearby, and there's no smart home integration with Alexa or Google. It's essentially a standalone keyless entry system with an app. For many people, that's enough — and at $70, it's hard to argue with the value.</p>
    <div class="pros-cons">
      <div class="pros"><strong>Pros</strong><ul><li>Incredible value at $70</li><li>Fingerprint + keypad entry</li><li>Solid build quality for the price</li><li>Easy installation</li></ul></div>
      <div class="cons"><strong>Cons</strong><ul><li>Bluetooth only — no remote access</li><li>No smart home integration</li><li>No auto-unlock</li><li>Basic app</li></ul></div>
    </div>
    <div class="cta-box">

  <h2>Smart Lock Buyer's Guide: What to Look For</h2>

  <h3>Retrofit vs. Full Replacement</h3>
  <p><strong>Retrofit locks</strong> (August, Level) replace only the inside of your existing deadbolt. You keep your keys and exterior hardware. They're easier to install, renter-friendly, and don't change your door's appearance. <strong>Full replacement locks</strong> (Yale, Schlage, Ultraloq, Kwikset, Wyze) replace the entire deadbolt assembly. They typically include a keypad for code entry, which retrofit locks usually don't.</p>
  <p>Our recommendation: if you rent or want the easiest install, go retrofit. If you own your home and want a keypad for guest access, go full replacement.</p>

  <h3>Connectivity: Wi-Fi vs. Bluetooth vs. Thread</h3>
  <p><strong>Wi-Fi:</strong> Lets you control the lock from anywhere via the internet. Required for remote access, Alexa/Google integration, and smart home automations. Uses more battery. <strong>Bluetooth:</strong> Only works when your phone is nearby. No remote access. Uses less battery. <strong>Thread:</strong> Low-power mesh networking. Fast response, works with Matter-compatible hubs. Best balance of battery life and functionality.</p>
  <p>For most people, Wi-Fi is the minimum you should look for. Thread is a bonus for future-proofing.</p>

  <h3>Security Ratings Explained</h3>
  <p>ANSI/BHMA grades rate a lock's physical security:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Grade 1:</strong> Highest residential security (Schlage Encode Plus). Withstands 800,000 cycles and 10 strikes.</li>
    <li><strong>Grade 2:</strong> Standard residential (most locks on this list). Withstands 400,000 cycles and 5 strikes.</li>
    <li><strong>Grade 3:</strong> Light residential. Avoid for exterior doors.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For a front door, Grade 2 is the minimum. Grade 1 is better if security is a top priority.</p>

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Are smart locks safe? Can they be hacked?</h3>
    <p>Smart locks from reputable brands use AES-128 or AES-256 encryption — the same standard used in banking. The realistic security risk isn't hacking (which requires specialized equipment and proximity), it's weak passwords on your smart home account. Use a strong, unique password and enable two-factor authentication.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>What happens if the battery dies?</h3>
    <p>Every lock on this list provides low-battery warnings weeks in advance. If the battery does die, most locks have a 9V battery terminal on the exterior for emergency power, plus a physical key backup. You won't be locked out.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Can I install a smart lock on my apartment?</h3>
    <p>Yes — with a retrofit lock like August or Level, you don't modify the exterior hardware or change the key. When you move out, remove the smart lock and reinstall the original interior mechanism. Takes 10 minutes. Check your lease, but most landlords won't even notice.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="faq-item">
    <h3>Do smart locks work with smart home automations?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely. Common automations: lock all doors at bedtime, unlock when you arrive home, send an alert when a guest code is used, turn on lights when the front door unlocks at night. Wi-Fi or Thread connectivity is required for these integrations.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
  <p>For most people, the <strong>August Wi-Fi Smart Lock (4th Gen)</strong> is the best smart lock in 2026. Its retrofit design means easy installation and renter-friendliness, auto-unlock is best-in-class, and it works with every ecosystem. Add the optional keypad for $50 if you need code access for guests.</p>
  <p>If you want a built-in keypad and full Matter future-proofing, the <strong>Yale Assure Lock 2</strong> is the best full-replacement option. And if budget is the priority, the <strong>Wyze Lock Bolt</strong> at $70 is a remarkable value for basic keyless entry.</p>
